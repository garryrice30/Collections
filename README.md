# Collections

This is literally just a collection of software that I have created. If any individual finds anything in this collection useful, please feel free to use everything as you see fit.

Keep in mind that all software created in this collection is "AS IS". If you spot some mistakes or want to give up some advice, fill free to e-mail me at garryrice4383@gmail.com and I'll likely respond to your e-mail as soon as I see it. Otherwise, I am not responsible for any damages that may or may not happen as a result of executing any of the software in this collection. You have been warned!

Each folder will have it's own README file inside of it. Please refer to it for details on individual projects. Thank you for taking the time to at least view the collection. I really do hope this collection helps someone out there in need of some guidance. We all need some from time to time!
